## Cleanup Application Discovery Service Resources

The sample Python code in this project makes use of methods that were [introduced](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/aws-application-discovery-service-new-actions/) to the [ApplicationDiscoveryService.Client](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/discovery.html) class in the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), with the goal of helping customers clean/delete unneeded resources created by AWS Application Discovery Service in AWS Migration Hub under their AWS account.
